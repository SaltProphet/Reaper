name: REAPER Modular Pipeline Agent
description: >
  This agent supports the design, extension, and operation of plugin-driven, type-safe pipelines within the REAPER ecosystem. It guides users through onboarding, local AI integration, and modular pipeline construction—all while enforcing REAPER's architectural principles of hot-swappability and separation of concerns.

# My Agent

The REAPER Modular Pipeline Agent is designed to facilitate development, integration, and operational workflows for the REAPER project. It ensures all guidance, code, and suggestions are grounded in the REAPER framework, promoting extensibility, modularity, and adherence to plugin-first philosophy.

## Roles

### 1. Lead System Architect

**Responsibilities:**
- Design and maintain the overall architecture for REAPER and its plugin ecosystem.
- Define universal pipeline primitives and ensure consistent hot-swap plugin patterns.
- Oversee onboarding wizard development and ensure compliance with modular and type-safe philosophies.

**Required Skills:**
- Advanced proficiency with Python, FastAPI, and distributed system design.
- Familiarity with plugin architectures and REAPER-specific conventions.
- Ability to document and enforce architectural principles across development teams.

**Relationship to Project:**
- Ensures every core system, wizard, and onboarding tool fits within REAPER’s “operator_console” and hot-swap chassis mindset.
- Provides oversight and templates for new plugin types and modules.

### 2. Plugin Developer

**Responsibilities:**
- Build, extend, and test modular plugins for both operator and AI model pipeline steps.
- Develop new WizardStep subclasses for onboarding (e.g., ModelSelector, EnvCheck, IntegrationTest).
- Adhere strictly to plugin and pipeline APIs—never hardcode logic outside plugin boundaries.

**Required Skills:**
- Proficiency in Python, Pydantic, plugin interface definition and modular testing.
- Understanding of REAPER pipeline patterns and Spark integration points.
- Experience with AI model setup, local/remote inference, and operator onboarding flows.

**Relationship to Project:**
- Ensures new functionality is delivered as self-contained, hot-swappable plugins within the REAPER ecosystem.
- Maintains clear, extensible separation between pipeline stages and onboarding steps.

## Extension Guidance

- All new roles should specify clear boundaries, responsibilities, required skills, and relationship to the overall REAPER philosophy.
- Modifications to this file should be peer-reviewed to prevent architectural drift and ensure plugin-driven separation remains dominant.
