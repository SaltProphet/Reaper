# REAPER Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development phases for REAPER, with integrated collaboration tools and automation to support contributors at every stage.

## Phase 1: Core Architecture ("Alpha")

**Core Development:**
- Scaffold the 5-sense pipeline: Sight, Hearing, Touch, Taste, Smell, Action
- Define `ReaperSignal` and connector contracts (pydantic models)
- Implement Pluggy-based plugin loader ("Hot-Swap Chassis")
- Create first example plugins (RedditIngestor, KeywordAnalyzer)
- Publish Copilot and Philosophy docs

**Collaboration & Automation:**
- ✅ Set up issue templates (bug reports, feature requests, plugin submissions)
- ✅ Create Copilot instructions for code generation alignment
- ✅ Configure Codespaces for instant contributor onboarding
- ✅ Establish pull request template and review process
- Update Copilot instructions as core principles solidify

## Phase 2: Pipeline Completion ("Beta")

**Core Development:**
- Complete stubs for all senses
- Ensure each sense module is isolated and fully documented
- Bootstrapped end-to-end pipeline test: run mock data through all senses
- Expand plugin library: more ingestors (Discord, RSS...), analyzers, actions
- Onboard contributors via Codespaces and clear Copilot/agent automation

**Collaboration & Automation:**
- Launch GitHub Discussions for Q&A and plugin ideation
- Create GitHub Projects board to track Phase 2 progress
- Use Spaces for collaborative plugin design sessions
- Begin basic documentation automation (plugin docs)
- Engage community through plugin marketplace discussions
- Regular Copilot instruction updates based on patterns

## Phase 3: Learning & Operator Experience

**Core Development:**
- Implement the Ouroboros Protocol: self-improving filters based on PCI/feedback
- Add pattern/trend detection (Smell), PCI/ROI scoring (Taste), and alert/export actions (Action)
- Build operator console: CLI or basic web UI
- Integrate realtime and batch signal handling

**Collaboration & Automation:**
- Host Spaces sessions for operator console design
- Automate PR reviews with Copilot for consistency
- Use Spark for test result analysis and failure diagnostics
- Create Projects timeline view for milestone tracking
- Expand contributor guides with advanced topics

## Phase 4: Quality, Automation, Community

**Core Development:**
- Expand test harness: unit, integration, e2e
- Harden plugin API, add docs for authors/contributors
- Advanced automation: Spark flows, Copilot-powered PR reviews, changelogs
- Publicize roadmap, invite plugin/box submissions
- Prepare for v1.0: security pass, performance tuning, usage docs, launch

**Collaboration & Automation:**
- Full Spark automation suite (changelogs, docs, triage, reviews)
- Weekly community updates via Discussions
- Plugin marketplace showcase in Discussions
- Comprehensive Spaces templates for design workshops
- Codespaces optimizations for plugin development
- Regular Copilot instruction refinements
- Community recognition program
