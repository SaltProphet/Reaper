# REAPER Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Architecture (“Alpha”)
- Scaffold the 5-sense pipeline: Sight, Hearing, Touch, Taste, Smell, Action
- Define `ReaperSignal` and connector contracts (pydantic models)
- Implement Pluggy-based plugin loader ("Hot-Swap Chassis")
- Create first example plugins (RedditIngestor, KeywordAnalyzer)
- Publish Copilot and Philosophy docs

## Phase 2: Pipeline Completion (“Beta”)
- Complete stubs for all senses
- Ensure each sense module is isolated and fully documented
- Bootstrapped end-to-end pipeline test: run mock data through all senses
- Expand plugin library: more ingestors (Discord, RSS...), analyzers, actions
- Onboard contributors via Codespaces and clear Copilot/agent automation

## Phase 3: Learning & Operator Experience
- Implement the Ouroboros Protocol: self-improving filters based on PCI/feedback
- Add pattern/trend detection (Smell), PCI/ROI scoring (Taste), and alert/export actions (Action)
- Build operator console: CLI or basic web UI
- Integrate realtime and batch signal handling

## Phase 4: Quality, Automation, Community
- Expand test harness: unit, integration, e2e
- Harden plugin API, add docs for authors/contributors
- Advanced automation: Spark flows, Copilot-powered PR reviews, changelogs
- Publicize roadmap, invite plugin/box submissions
- Prepare for v1.0: security pass, performance tuning, usage docs, launch
